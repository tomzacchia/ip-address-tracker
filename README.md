## The challenge

The following challenge description comes from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0):

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built With
* [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/)
